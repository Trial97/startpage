Small start page

This is a small implementation of a start page that once loaded is cached localy making posible to use it offline.

Be aware that because this firefox [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409675) extensions like [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) wil not be able to select/clean the url on new tab.
There is a extension that circumvents this: [Custom New Tab Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/)
